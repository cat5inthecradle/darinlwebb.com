>>In fact, perhaps that's part of where the anti-intellectualism comes from: even those who are considered "elite" see intellectual pursuits as only part of the game to gain wealth and prestige.

>With a little input from some robust, replicated research social psychology, this seems even more sinister than it looks on the surface. Cognitive Dissonance Theory suggests that people have unconscious explanations for their actions that, in certain situations, can compete with (and destroy) someones intrinsic interest in an activity. Applied to mandatory intellectual pursuits by ambitious elites, its quite easy to see how this could cause anti-intellectualism. Allow me to explain:
>
>Imagine that someone has a genuine, intrinsic love of poetry. Initially, her unconscious explanation for why she writes poetry is "I enjoy poetry, so I study poetry".
>
>Now let's imagine that this same person decides to leverage her knowledge of poetry to appear interesting on a medical school application. Now, her initial unconscious explanation of why she studies poetry ("I enjoy poetry, so I do it) is confronted with a new unconscious explanation ("Poetry will get me into medical school").
>
>Common sense dictates that she will have two motivations for studying poetry, so she will be even more driven to study poetry. She may very well put more effort into studying poetry. What's surprising is that the unconscious thought "poetry will get me into medical school, so I do it" actually tends to detract from the unconscious thought "I like poetry, so I do it"
>
>Research suggests that motivations for an activity are COMPETITIVE rather than additive. Someone pursuing poetry for the purpose of a med school app will slowly lose credence in the thought "I like poetry, so thats why I do it". Researchers infer this partially from surveys of self-reported enjoyment of the given activity. People who have an extrinsic interest in an activity tend to lose the intrinsic interest in that activity. Researchers also observe that when the extrinsic interest in an activity is eventually removed (the student successfully gets into med school) that person is less likely to pursue that same activity they once found compelling (she is likely to stop writing poetry after getting in to school, even though she once enjoyed it).
>
>This is one of the major problems with our education system - it destroys peoples natural interest in things academic. What do we get? Anti-intellectualism in people who have once had to pursue intellectual things for practical ends.
