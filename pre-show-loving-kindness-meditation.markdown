# Pre-Show Loving Kindness Meditation

## How to do it...

The practice always begins with developing a loving acceptance of yourself. If resistance is experienced then it indicates that feelings of unworthiness are present. No matter, this means there is work to be done, as the practice itself is designed to overcome any feelings of self-doubt or negativity. Then you are ready to systematically develop loving-kindness towards others.

* May I be free from inner and outer harm and danger. May I be safe and protected.
* May I be free of mental suffering or distress.
* May I be happy.
* May I be free of physical pain and suffering.
* May I be healthy and strong.
* May I be able to perform on this stage happily, peacefully, joyfully, with ease.


## Four Types Of Persons to develop loving-kindness towards</h1>

* a respected, beloved person - such as a teacher, mentor, writer, performer;
* a dearly beloved - someone in the troupe who you bond strongly with, who you love to share the stage with;
* a neutral person - somebody you know, but have no special feelings towards, someone you perhaps don't often share the stage with, or don't yet have a strong understanding of;
* a hostile person - someone you are currently having difficulty with, someone who you dread sharing the stage with.

Starting with yourself, then systematically sending loving-kindness from person to person in the above order will have the effect of breaking down the barriers between the four types of people and yourself. This will have the effect of breaking down the divisions within your own mind, the source of much of the conflict we experience. Try different people to practice on, as some people do not easily fit into the above categories, but do try to keep to the prescribed order. If you have difficulty with a person, and continue to experience feelings of ill will towards them, switch back to the beloved people to continue those feelings of loving kindness.

## Ways of arousing feelings of loving-kindness

1. Visualisation - Bring up a mental picture. See yourself or the person the feeling is directed at smiling back at you or just being joyous.
2. Reflection - Reflect on the positive qualities of a person and the acts of kindness they have done. And to yourself, making an affirmation, a positive statement about yourself, using your own words.
3. Auditory - This is the simplest way but probably the most effective. Repeat an internalized mantra or phrase such as 'loving-kindness'.
 * May I/they be free from inner and outer harm and danger. May I be safe and protected.
 * May I/they be free of mental suffering or distress.
 * May I/they be happy.
 * May I/they be free of physical pain and suffering.
 * May I/they be healthy and strong.
 * May I/they be able to perform on this stage happily, peacefully, joyfully, with ease.

## Closing The Meditation

Once you have arisen positive feelings of loving kindness, turn that loving kindness outward to broader things

* Your troupe as a whole, what it is and can become
* Your fellow improvisors city, nation, and worldwide
* The audience waiting to see your show
* The people of your city who chose to stay at home
* All people in the world

_"May all living beings everywhere, on all planes of existence, known and unknown, be happy, be peaceful, be free from suffering."_
