About This Site
===============

This site is an excercise in both minimalism, and in complexity. The content of this site is written entirely in ''markdown''. It's not so much a programming language, as it is a formatting style. There are a limited number of stylistic elements, like ''strongness'' or 'emphasis' that can be used, but they are marked in such a way that the raw "code" of the page is just as visually intresting and styled as the formatted text shown in a browser.

The ability for the code to stand on it's own greatly reduced my reliance on editors, templates, and any of the many content management systems. I can focus on writing content, and not worry so much about how everything looks.

The limited amount of formatting available in markdown helps me focus on simple content that doesn't rely on fancy formatting or clever visual elements. By limiting myself to headings, lists, and simple emphasis modifications, I can share ideas in a simple structured way.

This simplicity does still allow the opportunity to indulge in some enhancements. While the files can stand on their own, building a back end to serve and organize the files will sate my problem solving drive. I will be adding a bit of JSON code at the bottom of each post to add some metadata. For now this will be keywords and datestamps. The website code around the pages will format the markdown to it's styled form, and use the metadata to allow a more organized experience.

This entire site will be shared [on GitHub](https://github.com/cat5inthecradle/darinlwebb.com).
